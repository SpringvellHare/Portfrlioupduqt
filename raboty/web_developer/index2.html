            <p class="history_text">The first steps in building a global computer network were taken in the 1960s, and in 1969 there was a "premiere" session between two remote subscribers. In the following decades, the Internet was used by a small number of narrow specialists. The situation changed dramatically in the early 1990s, when personal computers came into use, and universal access to the World Wide Web was provided by browsers with a good interface (e.g. NCSA Mosaic).</p>
            <p class="history_text">Only a quarter of a century has passed since then, and the Internet is already used by more than half of the world's population. The World Wide Web has penetrated into all areas of human activity, it is indispensable in the financial sector, services, communications, etc. Professions related to information technology have arisen en masse, one of the most scarce among them - a programmer of network resources.
            So, who is a web developer (or developer). This is a qualified specialist who, using different programming languages, writes, updates, fixes and improves the algorithms for all kinds of desktop and mobile applications, websites. Such activity develops the Internet industry and makes digital products as user-friendly as possible.</p>
